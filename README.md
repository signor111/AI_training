        When I uploaded the files, I transferred them all to the master branch. I researched some guides and attempted  
    to merge the two branches, but an error occurred.I wasn't sure how to resolve it, so I didn't make any further changes.

        Additionally, the README file needed to include some images to demonstrate the entire project process,  
    so I uploaded it in the .docx format instead of Markdown.
